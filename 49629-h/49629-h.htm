  <div class="i0">So list you while I sing the luck of happy Hezekiah.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">My wife she was no milliner, or any other trade, sir.</div>
  <div class="i0">But was what I ne’er blush to own, a charming servant-maid, sir.</div>
  <div class="i0">I courted her, ’twas in a house, where she used to build the fires,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I’ve ne’er had cause to curse the day she first was Hezekiah’s.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I ne’er have cause for jealousy, I <a name="never"></a>never take home codgers,</div>
  <div class="i0">And what is more, I ne’er take in any single young men lodgers.</div>
  <div class="i0">I always do go home to tea, then draw up to the fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">My wife she reads, or mends the coat of happy Hezekiah.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">My wife and I we ne’er fall out, we love each other dearly,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of affections ’tis a fact, a pledge is sent us yearly.</div>
  <div class="i0">And what adds more unto the joy, which a parent should inspire,</div>
  <div class="i0">The children are the image of their father, Hezekiah.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">We four dear children now have got, and do expect another,</div>
  <div class="i0">The boys myself I do bring up, the girls I leave to their mother.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus with the children and my wife, my own, my loved Sophia,</div>
  <div class="i0">So pleasantly doth pass the life of happy Hezekiah.</div>

 <h3 class="p2">The Girl I left behind Me.</h3>

  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I’m lonesome since I cross’d the hills</div>
  <div class="i1">And o’er the moor that’s sedgy;</div>
  <div class="i0">With heavy thoughts my mind is fill’d,</div>

  <div class="i0">Whene’er I turn to view the place,</div>

  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The hours I remember well,</div>
  <div class="i1">When next to see doth move me,</div>
  <div class="i0">The burning flames my heart doth tell,</div>
  <div class="i1">Since first she own’d she loved me.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">In search of some one fair and gay,</div>
  <div class="i1">Several doth remind me;</div>
  <div class="i0">I know my darling loves me well,</div>
  <div class="i1">Though I left her behind me.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The bees shall lavish, make no store,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Each mutual promise faithful made,</div>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I was raised in Mississippi, where the sugar-cane grows tall,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I loved a pretty yellow girl, much sweeter than them all.</div>
  <div class="i0">She left the place one moonlight night&mdash;we sorrow’d much to part;</div>
  <div class="i0">No token did she leave me, but her picture on my heart,</div>
  <div class="i1">And I moan, and I groan, all alone, all alone.</div>
  </div>
  <p class="center smaller">CHORUS</p>
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But fretting won’t do for a darkey of this figure&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i2">Time enough for that when he gits a little bigger;</div>
  <div class="i2">Dancing with the yellow girls, and shucking out the corn,</div>
  <div class="i2">Will make him forget ’Tilda Horn.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">While ago I got a letter from her, thinking, as I sat,</div>
  <div class="i0">If I met her, how she’d like me, in my stylish Kossuth hat.</div>
  <div class="i0">’Twas the last I heard about her, and since then I’m much in dread</div>
  <div class="i0">That’s she’s married to another man, or else she must “gone dead.”</div>
  <div class="i1">In despair, I declare, I is crack’d, that’s a fact.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But fretting won’t do, &amp;c.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Now I go about, down in the mouth, and stockings down at heel;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like Massa Shakspeare’s Hamlet, too. I’m touch’d up here I feel.</div>
  <div class="i0">His uncle gave him good advice&mdash;mine took my clothes in pawn;</div>
  <div class="i0">And all to raise the cash to dress&mdash;deceitful ’Tilda Horn.</div>
  <div class="i1">Oh! this wool I could pull, this poor heart is so full.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But fretting won’t do, &amp;c.</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Since the Shakspere’s coming in my head, I’m like Othello, too,</div>
  <div class="i0">The victim of my jealous fears, I don’t know what to do;</div>
  <div class="i0">Desdemona lost his handkerchief&mdash;that wasn’t much to lose;</div>
  <div class="i0">But ’Tilda took my ’bacca-box, my shirts, and Sunday shoes,</div>
  <div class="i1">Now I stray all the day, from the gay far away.</div>
  </div><br />

 <h4 class="p2">Transcriber’s Notes</h4>

<p>Missing punctuation was added to abbreviations, contractions, ends of
sentences, and list entries at the end of the book. Missing and
unprinted letters were added. Where letters were printed upside down,
they were considered printer’s errors and were corrected (e.g.
Chorns/Chorus, hobe/hope, ofteu/often). The first three entries to the
contents of Union Songbook No. 1 are missing letters in the original.
The last entry to contents of Dime Song Book No. 2 is out of
alphabetical order in the original. In handheld devices, words in
small caps and gesperrt in the original appear as bold.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
